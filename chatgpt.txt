can you write a scatter data chart using react, styled-components and d3 ? paint the male data points blue and the female data points pink, the "other" gender paint grey. Make the background white and the domain [0, 500] pixels, request the data from the backend on the route "http://localhost:4816/clients"

the data format is as such : 



let a = [
  {
    index: 1,
    genero: null,
    idade: 118,
    id: "68be06ca386d4c31939f3a4f0e3dd783",
    membro_desde: "20170212",
    renda_anual: null,
  },
  {
    index: 2,
    genero: "F",
    idade: 55,
    id: "0610b486422d4921ae7d2bf64640c50b",
    membro_desde: "20170715",
    renda_anual: 112000.0,
  },
];



gender is" genero" it can be "O", "F" or "M" meaning ( Other, Female, Male ) 
age is "idade" ( its a integer in years)
id is a sha256 format string
member_since is "membro_desde" which is formated as YYYYMMDD concatenated, so  january first 2020 is "20200101"
anual_income is "renda_anual" its an integer string
